        This is a website where you can track what you eat. You can Design ,Customize and Organize
        foods, meals and diet plans to your liking, and also track various self defined goals
        with a high degree of customisability and have easy access to helpful information.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        While preselecting foods through scanning codes and importing lists from various places will
        be available in the future, the Main Functionality of this site revolves around providing a
        a simple practical and flexible framework where YOU Define and Organize your stuff and can potentially completely ignore anything else.
      </p>
      <p><br />
        This has been entirely made from scratch by me (o/ hi!) mostly because other similar websites seem to want to box you into a way of doing things and predefine certain goals for you while also expecting you to pick from many predefined items. I found this rather confusing or restrictive and annoying.
        BUT here if you feel like making a user called Worm69 that eats 2grams of Dirt and Fungus 30 times a day you can do that!(please don't tho..)
      </p><br />
      <p><span>As a Guest you have Certain Limitations:</span> You can only log food in a specific time period and also have limits on how many entries you can asign to your daily meals. The Guest is only here to quick demonstrations on how this site functions and the data you enter is NOT Realiable/Persistent for long terms.
        (also as this site is currently running for free and will receive major changes-including the database- The Data you put in might get wiped/changed in the future).
      </p>
      <p><br />
        This site is in constant development and tends to get frequent (often daily) updates.
        Right now you can make an account, change profile details, and in DailyMeals section you can
        add/change Meals to days you select, and add Food Items to Meals.
        You can do this either by searching through a list of Foods(right now comprises of what I've eaten lately) or create your own foods. Right now you can only add simple foods with a name and brand, macronutrients and size/portion information. More will come.
        <br />
      </p>
      <p><br />
        But you can attach notes to days and meals. Notes consist of a score, a title and text.
        You use this system to write how you felt about a meal, keep track of alergies/odd reactions/blood sugar or really anything you want. You can find a list of my notes but they probably won't help much because it's personal to me. The list will change to something more general/better later on.
